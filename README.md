# ros-rrt

RRT algorithm implementation in rospy.

## Execution

On src/rrt/scripts folder execute python2 assignment.py

## Algorithm Tuning

Some parameters of this algorithm can be modified easily. For instance, to modify the step size simply change the value of variable STEP. The videos included are executions of the algorithm with step size equals to 1 and 0.5 respectively.

## Notes

This code was tested on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver), ROS 12th (Melodic Morenia), and python 2.7.15.
